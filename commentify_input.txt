Display(str)

Description:
The function is passed a <null> terminated string (str) to output to the LED display. The string is passed by reference in ES:SI (i.e. the address of the string is ES:SI). Note that ES is used (as opposed to DS) so the string can be in the code segment (i.e. it can be a constant string) without needing to change DS, which can cause many problems. The str is converted to its segment representation and stored in the shared variable buffer.

Operation:
Each ASCII value in the string is processed one at a time until the <null> character has been reached or NUM_DIGITS has been added to the buffer. The segment code for each ASCII value is looked up in the ASCIISegTable and stored in the display buffer.

Pseudo Code:

ASCII_NULL EQU 0
NUM_DIGITS EQU 8

Index = 0
WHILE str != ASCII_NULL index < NUM_DIGITS:
    STORE(buffer + index, ASCIISegTable[str])
    str += 1
    index += 1


Arguments:        str(ES:SI) -   16-bit memory address where <null> terminated string is stored to be output to the display. It is important to note the string is not stored in the default segment DS for SI but in segment ES.
Return Values:    None

Local Variables:  index(AX) - The index of the current buffer digit being written to.
Shared Variables: buffer      - Array of words for 14-segment display to be output to LED-display.
                  cur_segment - The current index in the buffer being displayed.
