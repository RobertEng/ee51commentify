; Display(str)
; 
; description:      
; The function is passed a <null> terminated string (str) to output to the LED
; display. The string is passed by reference in ES:SI (i.e. the address of the
; string is ES:SI). Note that ES is used (as opposed to DS) so the string can
; be in the code segment (i.e. it can be a constant string) without needing to
; change DS, which can cause many problems. The str is converted to its segment
; representation and stored in the shared variable buffer.
; 
; operation:        
; Each ASCII value in the string is processed one at a time until the <null>
; character has been reached or NUM_DIGITS has been added to the buffer. The
; segment code for each ASCII value is looked up in the ASCIISegTable and
; stored in the display buffer.
; 
; Pseudo Code:
; 
; ASCII_NULL EQU 0
; NUM_DIGITS EQU 8
; 
; Index = 0
; WHILE str != ASCII_NULL index < NUM_DIGITS:
;     STORE(buffer + index, ASCIISegTable[str])
;     str += 1
;     index += 1
; 
; 
; arguments:        str(ES:SI) - 16-bit memory address where <null> terminated
; string is stored to be output to the display. It is important to note the
; string is not stored in the default segment DS for SI but in segment ES.
; return values:    None
; 
; local variables:  index(AX)  - The index of the current buffer digit being
; written to.
; shared variables: buffer     - Array of words for 14-segment display to be
; output to LED-display.
;                   cur_segment - The current index in the buffer being
; displayed.

; global variables: None

; inputs:           None
; outputs:          The display on the display unit will show the input string
; str.
